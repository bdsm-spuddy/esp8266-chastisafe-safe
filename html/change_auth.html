<form method=post action=safe/ enctype="multipart/form-data">
To set the user name and password needed to access the safe:
<br>
Safe Username: <input name=username size=40 value="##ui_username##">
<br>
Safe Password: <input name=password size=40>  (keep blank to leave unchanged)
<p>
<input type=submit value="Set Auth Details" name=setauth>

If the change is accepted, you will need to login again.

To talk to the Chastisafe Server you need to enter your API access token
details.  See the README on how to find this
<br>
Access token: <input name=token size=40 value="##token##">
<p>
<input type=submit value="Set API Details" name=setapi>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="/renew">Renew now</a>
<p>
If this value is incorrect you will not be able to talk to the server
and will need to correct it.
<p>
The default endpoint this software talks to is the Chastisafe API.
This may be changed here (if no lock is running) to another endpoint
that supports the same endpoints.

<input name=apiurl size=50 value="##apiurl##">

<input type=submit value="Change API URL" name=setapiurl>
